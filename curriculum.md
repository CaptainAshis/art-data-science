# Curriculum

## INTRO: “I think therefore, I am"

- What is data science?
- What type of questions can be answered?
- Frame/Acquire/Refine/Explore/Model/Insight framework

## FRAME - “Framing the problem is often far more essential than its solution”

- How to frame a data science problem?
- Learn the hypothesis-driven approach?
- How do you start - question driven, dataset driven or both?

## ACQUIRE - “Data is the new oil”

- Download from an internal system, client or other 3rd party
- Extracted from a web-based API
- Scraped from a website / pdfs
- Gathered manually and recorded
- Acquire data from a csv file or a database
- Acquire data from a 3rd part client (e.g. twitter)


## REFINE - “Data is messy”

- Concept of Tidy Data - Why is it important?
- Missing e.g. Check for missing or incomplete data
- Quality e.g. Check for duplicates, accuracy, unusual data
- Parse e.g. extract year from date
- Merge e.g. first and surname for full name
- Convert e.g. free text to coded value
- Remove e.g. remove redundant data

## TRANSFORM - “What is measured may not help answer what is required”

- Aggregate e.g. rollup by year, cluster by area
- Derive e.g. gender from title
- Calculate e.g. percentages, proportion
- Filter e.g. exclude based on location
- Sample e.g. extract a representative data
- Summary e.g. show summary stats like mean
- Basic statistics: variance, standard deviation, co-variance, correlation

## EXPLORE - “I don’t know, what I don’t know”

- Why do visual exploration?
- Understand Data Structure & Types
- Grammar of Graphics and Basics of visualisation
- Explore single variable graphs - (Quantitative, Categorical)
- Explore dual variable graphs - (Q & Q, Q & C, C & C)
- Explore multi-dimensional variable graphs

## MODEL - “All models are wrong, But some  are useful”

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- The power and limits of models
- Tradeoff between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Assessing Model Accuracy

## INSIGHT - “The goal is to turn data into insight”

- Why do we need to communicate insight?
- Types of communication - Exploration vs. Explanation
- Explanation: Telling a story with data
- Exploration: Building an interface for people to find stories
